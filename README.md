This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because the loop attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds. The solution adjusts the loop condition to prevent this.
